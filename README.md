# Handwritten-Character-Recognition-Using-Neural-Network
This project implements a neural-network-based system capable of identifying handwritten characters from images. It focuses on building a model that can learn patterns in handwriting and classify characters with reliable accuracy. The workflow covers data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and prediction.
